        The study of Computer Science is critical if society is to take full advantage of the benefits of Information Technology has to offer
         and make quick changes. Computer science involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers.
          At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire  Computer Scientists expect adept programmers 
          with knowledge of current techniques. The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes,
         Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single Major and Major-Minor as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
