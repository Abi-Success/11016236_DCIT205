                The Computer Science Department at the University of Ghana offers two post graduate programs: a Master     of Science (MSc.) in Computer Science and a Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) in Computer Science. <br>
                The MSc. program lasts for one year and can be taken on weekends or evenings. On the other hand 
                the MPhil. is a two year program. The first year consists of taught courses, while the second year 
                focuses on research and disseration. Students in these programs gain a deep understanding of theoretical 
                computer science and develop advanced technical skills to deal with complex global programs using 
                technology as a powerful tool.
